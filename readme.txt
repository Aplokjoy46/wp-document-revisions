WordPress Document Revisions

== Description ==

WordPress Document Management – a workflow management and version control system for WordPress building on its existing core competencies. By treating documents as a custom post type, users can leverage the power of WordPress’s extensive attachment, revision, taxonomy, and URL rewriting functionalities. Document permalinks can be routed through the traditional rewrite structure such that the latest revision of a file always remains at a static, authenticated URL, and users can toggle the visibility of documents (both internally and externally) as they currently do with post statuses and permissions. Similarly, file locking can extend WordPress’s autosave functionality (as a ping), revision logs can extend WordPress’s existing revision relationship and can be outputted as a traditional RSS feed, etc.
